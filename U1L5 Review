# 1: The code will take the length inputted and square it, giving the product as area
# 3: When I inputted 2, the code squared the number into 4, stated the answer and stopped
# 4: 

import math
print("Area of a Norman Window shape")
rad = input("Input the circle's radius: ")
rad = float(rad)
area = ((0.5*math.pi(math.pow(rad, 2))) + 4*math.pow(rad, 2))
print("Area is:", area)
